						"The great library of Shamayilm at the magical University of Baloch has been broken into and some obscure books have gone missing. At the beginning of the summer break, thugs and assassins caused commotion in the campus and some surrounding areas. Master Sage Parma needs to send an adventuring party to retrieve the lost pages. Her biggest fear is what the instigator of the theft might want to do with the stolen pages, the knowledge being incredibly old arcana that may possibly be associated with demonic forces.",
						"Unbeknownst to most, the powerful and mysterious individual who now has possession of the pages, wants to open an extra-dimensional portal to allow a being known as the Queen of Darkness to come into the world and affect individuals therein. Unless he is stopped, the history and peoples of the world as it is known will be in danger of being erased forever."

The migrant individuals (often arriving in different locations and at different times) found remnants of cities and civilisations that had seemingly long since been destroyed. Repurposing these ruins, a new and thriving world has been build, but like any world, there is a chequered history with many rivalries.",
						"The geography of the planet is simple in theory. The Southern Empire and its nations are in the south-east , whilst the various, disparate Nations of the North lie towards the northeast. In practice however, there are many hostile lands in between nations, where most people fear to tread.

The primary languages of these nations are also the two most common languages of the Empire: the Common Tongue (Zuban) and the Second Tongue (Dusuri).",
								"Life in the Southern Empire is generally prosperous but as with any civilisation, inequalities are almost inevitable. Particularly between those living in the country and those in the cities. There is also a sense of superiority in Southern folk that the Northern Nations are less sophisticated (to put it mildly)."

								"At present there is peace between the Northern Nations and the Southern Empire, but the nations among themselves have ever-lasting rivalries fought out in smaller battles. Little else is known about life in the Northern Nations but more may be gleaned from former residents who have moved to Southern Imperial cities in search of a different life."

								"The Weave is a subject of study in many universities - some theorise its power comes from god(s) and others that it is simply a fact of existence. Regardless, many deities can grant additional magic to their followers, as can powerful extraplanar creatures (though such pacts would may often be looked upon as suspicious)."

Although the gods do not manifest in matters of the world, clerics can be granted divine power, those with more nefarious motives may perform dark deeeds in the names of their gods, and shining paladins can stand like beacons against the darkness. It is difficult to be ambivalent about the deities and deny their existence in such a world.",
								"Many people have a favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teachings they make their own. And a few people dedicate themselves entirely to a single god, usually serving as a priest or champion of that godâ€™s ideals. You can learn more about gods in the world by speaking to individuals or visiting temples/shrines to a particular god."
