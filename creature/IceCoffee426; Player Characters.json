					"Erza has had a difficult past. Her family, historically with many wizards who studied magic that was forbidden in the kingdom of Ryderia, are now just moderate merchants with one large estate. Though not exactly the apple of her parents' eye, her Nana always encouraged her to be herself and to pursue her own interests, despite her feeling like an outsider among her peers.",
					"Eventually, she studied magic hard enough to be able to gain entry to Baloch Mahar University in the south. Her Nana paid for the travel and deposit so Erza could study in the South, unimpeded by the archaic laws in the North. Over many years, and overcoming some prejudice, she has risen to the position of Head Librarian of the Shamayilm library at the university.",
					"As a hugely respected member of the community, Erza has risen incredibly far in arcane academia, but she still struggles a little in her personal interactions. Her boss and (only real friend) is Master Sage Parma - a fairy who oversees much of the magical research at Baloch Univserity."

					"Youngest of the prime branch of the Nai'igal family, Aramil grew up wealthy and spoilt. With little chance of inheriting the large family seats, he was tutored in the ways of a warrior to further the family's secret goals.",
					"For generations, the Nai'igal's, in exchange for power and riches, have been doing the bidding of a demon named Rakasha, doing her bidding in the material plane. Aramil failed consistently in his studies, despite being intelligent and strong, as he was undisciplined and unmotivated, instead choosing a life of hedonism.",
					"During a moment of apathy, Aramil inadvertently started a fire in one of the family vaults at which he was training, killing his instructor and destroying many relics in the process. His parents, after a stern discussion where Aramil refused to change his ways, shipped him to Baloch to study at the unversity, effectively cutting him off and washing their hands of his poor attitude and lack of interest in the family's values.",
					"The life of a student (and likely a merchant or mercenary thereafter) is not one that suits Aramil. Willing to do anything to find favour with his family again and return to a lavish lifestlye, he is using his spare time from his studies looking for any artefacts that could serve Rakasha's mysterious goals. Oddly, however, he is for the first time finding enjoyment in his studies and having an element of stucture in his life."
