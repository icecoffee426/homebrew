					"His parents, after a stern discussion where Aramil refused to change his ways, shipped him to Baloch to study at the unversity, effectively cutting him off and washing their hands of his poor attitude and lack of interest in the family's values.",
					"The life of a student (and likely a merchant or mercenary thereafter) is not one that suits Aramil. Willing to do anything to find favour with his family again and return to a lavish lifestlye, he is using his spare time from his studies looking for any artefacts that could serve Rakasha's mysterious goals. Oddly, however, he is for the first time finding enjoyment in his studies and having an element of stucture in his life."
